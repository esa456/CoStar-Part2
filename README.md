# CoStar-Part2
CoStar project part 2

The purpose of this project is to scrape the data specified in 'https://bradvisors.com/listing'

# Assumptions
For the purpose of this task an assumption was made that for sale/under contract properties were available immediately.

For rent properties overall availability could not be inferred as some had multiple floors and so the sale_stage of these properties would be set to 'N/A', however, more details on that would be found in spaces, if applicable.

# Installation and run
To deploy and install the dependencies to this project run _pip install -r requirements.txt_
